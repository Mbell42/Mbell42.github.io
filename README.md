Progress:

------------
2020.03.17_0808 - Initial Commit.  Created and cloned repository to my local drive.  I then imported 'assets' folder from class files.

2020.03.21_1856 - Completed research for assignment (12 hours), then created necessary folder structure and files.  I then added '.gitignore file' and initialized npm 'package.json', and began pseudo-coding.

2020.03.21_2001 - I added dependencies to 'index.js', then built the 'dbConnect' function in 'db-connect.js'.  I then added the MySql code necessary to create the schema and tables in 'schema.sql'.  

2020.03.21_2038 - I added'db-actions.js'.  Then I updated 'db-classes.js' to include empty classes for 'Employee','EmployeeRole', and 'Department'.  I then continued to pseudo-code in 'index.js' and 'db-actions.js'.

2020.03.21_2230 - I completed constructor functions and added empty action functions for each class in 'db-classes.js', and then deleted 'db-actions.js'.  For 'index.js', I began constructing the initialize function.

2020.03.21_2316 - I added the rest of the cases to the case switch in 'index.js' and then added functions to the classes 'Employee' and 'EmployeeRole' in 'db-classes.js'.

2020.03.21_2325 - I have run into an issue with trying to import multiple classes from a single external .js file.  I will submit the assignment as it is to make sure that I have a submission in, and then will attempt to fix the issue.  After that, I will complete 'seeds.sql'.
