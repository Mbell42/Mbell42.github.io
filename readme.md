2020.02.18.2245 - Initial Commit.  Initialized readme.me, and set up folder structure.  Created index.html, contact.html, portfolio.html, style.css, and logic.js.

2020.02.18.2315 - Added plan.txt, and updated instructions.md to insructions.txt.  Updated my LinkedIn Profile with links to my GitHub Profile and Portfolio site.  Updated GitHub Bio. 

2020.02.21.1607 - Updated plan.txt to reflect recent pivot; marked new tasks and completed tasks.  For this homework's dependencies (the two exemplary homeworks to be displayed), I updated/fixed and pushed my changes to both the Weather App and Work Day Scheduler previous homework assignments.  Researched Bootstrap examples for grid structure, head/nav/jumbotron, sidebar, and sticky footer elements.

2020.02.21.1630 - I updated index.html to include assimilated portions of code from my previous homework assignment '02_responsive-portfolio', as a starting point.  I added an images folder to the folder structure, containing images that were used in '02_responsive-portfolio'. 

2020.02.21.1902 - I added 'contact.html' and 'portfolio.html' within the folder 'pages'.  I then updated grid layout for 'index.html', and then copied the skeleton over to 'contact.html' and 'portfolio.html'.  For 'contact.html' I added my contact form from previous homework assignment '02_responsive-portfolio', and then updated and fixed its position in the grid layout.  I updated header, main, and footer section sizes in 'style.css'. For each 'html' page, I updated the position of the columns in the headers.

2020.02.21.2353 - For '.html' pages and 'style.css', I updated the header/navbar and footer sections, such that the position of my name and the navpills are corrected, and the height of the navbar and footer are adjusted.

2020.02.22.0051 - For '.html' pages and 'style.css', I added contact details, and setup sections for links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Vimeo profiles.  I checked column counts in each row, and fixed any that did not add up to 12.

2020.02.22.0156 - For '.html' pages, I updated classes and comments.  For 'portfolio.html', I added card structure within the main panel, filling with lorem ipsum placeholder info.

2020.02.22.2158 - For '.html' pages, I updated link hrefs to point towards their correct destinations, and for 'portfolio.html', I added images for featured projects, and adjusted their sizes to fit the text-width in their respective columns.  For '.html' pages, I updated border styles for 'p' tags.  I then updated links to open to a new tab.  I then began tinkering with background and text color combinations.  I then updated img-sizes to be square and cleaned up unused imgs in the img folder. 

2020.02.22.2316 - For '.html' pages, I added a nav link targeting my resume.

2020.02.22.2316 - For 'style.css' pages, I updated gray backgrounds to use a background image from 'https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/mocha-grunge/'.  I also updated my profile picture on 'index.html', my LinkedIn profile, and my GitHub profile.

2020.02.22.2316 - For 'style.css' pages, I updated the header to include 'sm' sizes for columns, alleviating some of the issues experienced on smaller browser windows.

2020.02.24.0220 - This push contains element position fixes for mobile screens and large screens.  For 'style.css' pages, I added '@media' queries for three different sizes, and added several sizing, position, and padding styles.  For '.html' pages, I added sm and lg sizes to columns, and updated column sizes based on screen size.
